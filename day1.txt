This is me taking the 10 days of git and github challenge.

Day 1 is about basic unix commands.

Neofetch: data about the device 
Pwd: Check the current directory:
ls: List directories and files in the current directory
mkdir: Make (create) directories
nano: Create files
cd: Change directory
mv: Rename the file/directory, move the file/directory
cp: Copy files or directories
nano: Write in to the file
cat: Read the file
rmdir: delete directory
rm: delete file
rm -r: deletes anything (better to use this command)
